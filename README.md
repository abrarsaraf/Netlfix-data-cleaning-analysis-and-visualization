The primary objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Netflix movie and TV show dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. By leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project aims to identify key metrics like content distribution over time, genre popularity, ratings distribution, and the presence of country-wise content. This analysis helps better understand Netflix's content strategy and provides data-driven insights into viewer preferences.
